# CYK Algorithm Script

A Java implementation of the CYK (Cocke-Younger-Kasami) algorithm to parse and check if a string belongs to a language defined by a context-free grammar.

## Code summary

The script reads a context-free grammar from a file and checks if a given word can be generated by that grammar using the CYK algorithm. 

1. **Grammar and word input:**
   - The grammar is read from a file named `gramatica3.txt`.
   - The word to be checked is hardcoded as `"uupzupiuupp"`.

2. **CYK Algorithm:**
   - Parses the grammar rules and initializes necessary data structures.
   - Uses dynamic programming to fill a 3D table `dp` where `dp[i][j][k]` is true if the substring from index `i` to `j` can be generated by the non-terminal `k`.

3. **Steps of the algorithm:**
   - **Initialization:** Sets the base cases for single-character substrings.
   - **Filling the table:** Iteratively fills the table for substrings of increasing length.
   - **Result:** The result is found in `dp[0][n-1][0]`, indicating if the whole word can be generated by the start symbol.

4. **Main function:**
   - Reads the grammar from the file.
   - Calls the `cyk` function to check if the word can be generated by the grammar.
   - Prints the result.

## Complexity and efficiency

The time complexity of the CYK algorithm is O(n^3 * |G|), where n is the length of the input string and |G| is the size of the grammar. The space complexity is O(n^2 * |G|) due to the 3D table used for dynamic programming.
