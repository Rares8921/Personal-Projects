## üõ† Programming Techniques and Tools

In these projects, I applied various advanced programming and software engineering principles, such as:

- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Used extensively in projects like **Ethereal Eclipse** and the **Chess game**, encapsulating game logic into reusable components.
- **Design Patterns**: Applied patterns such as Factory, Singleton, and Observer to optimize game structure and ensure maintainability.
- **Modular Design**: Decomposing functionality into independent, reusable modules.
- **MVC Architecture**: Utilized in larger projects to separate the user interface from the game logic and data management.
- **Memory Management**: Extensive use of manual memory management in C++ to handle object lifecycles and optimize performance.
- **Concurrency**: Implemented multithreading for certain performance-critical sections, such as parallel computation in image editing or simulations.
