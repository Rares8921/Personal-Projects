#Guess the number

A console game where the player is asked to guess a number randomly chosen from 1 to 100. The player has a total of 3 chances to guess.

##Code summary

Firstly, to generate the number, the "random" library is used. After, the user is asked to give a number, and after each guess the program will tell if the number was correct or if it was smaller or bigger. The program will end when the number is guessed or when the player has used their chances.

##Complexity and efficiency
The randint function has O(1) time and space complexity.
The algorithm utilises a series of if and else statements, which result in a O(1) time complexity.
In the program there are a few variables that are used, so the space complexity is O(1)
Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(1), as well as the space complexity.
