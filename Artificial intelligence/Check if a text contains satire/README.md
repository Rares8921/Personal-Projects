# Text Classification for Satire Detection

A machine learning algorithm that classifies news articles as either satire or non-satire based on their titles and content. The algorithm uses a Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) to perform the classification.

## Code summary

Firstly, the necessary libraries are imported, including `numpy`, `pandas`, `sklearn.feature_extraction.text`, `sklearn.model_selection`, `sklearn.pipeline`, and `sklearn.svm`. The training data is then loaded from a CSV file, and any missing values in the `title` and `content` columns are filled with empty strings. The `class` column, which indicates whether an article is satire, is filled with zeros for missing values. The data is split into training and testing sets.

The text data is vectorized using `CountVectorizer` to convert it into a frequency matrix, which is then transformed using `TfidfTransformer` to represent the term frequency-inverse document frequency. A Linear SVM is used for the classification, with a regularization parameter `C` set to 100.0. These steps are combined into a single pipeline which is then trained on the training data.

## Complexity and efficiency

The `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfTransformer` both have a complexity that depends on the number of documents and the size of the vocabulary, typically O(N*V) where N is the number of documents and V is the size of the vocabulary. The training of the Linear SVM depends on the number of samples and features, with a time complexity generally between O(N^2) and O(N^3).

The space complexity of `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfTransformer` is also O(N*V) as they need to store the frequency matrix and the transformed TF-IDF matrix. The SVM model itself has a space complexity that depends on the number of support vectors, which can be up to O(N).

Overall, the time complexity is approximately O(N^2) to O(N^3) for the training phase, and the space complexity is O(N*V) for the vectorization and transformation steps.
