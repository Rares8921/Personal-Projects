# QR Code Generation Script

A Python script that generates a QR code using the `qrcode` library. The script encodes a given data (in this case, a YouTube link) into a QR code and saves it as an image file.

## Code summary

Firstly, the necessary library `qrcode` is imported. The script sets the data to be encoded into the QR code, which is a URL link to a YouTube video in this example.

An instance of the `QRCode` class is created with specific parameters: `version`, `box_size`, and `border`. The data is added to the QR code instance using the `add_data` method.

The `make` method with `fit=True` is called to ensure the QR code is properly sized to fit the provided data. The QR code image is then created with specified fill and background colors (`fill_color` and `back_color`).

Finally, the generated QR code image is saved as a PNG file named `QRCode.png`.

## Complexity and efficiency

The time complexity of generating a QR code primarily depends on the size and complexity of the input data and the version of the QR code. The `QRCode` class handles the encoding process, which involves error correction and matrix generation. The complexity is typically O(N^2) for the encoding process, where N is the size of the QR code matrix.

The space complexity is also influenced by the QR code version, as higher versions require more storage space for the matrix. The `box_size` and `border` parameters further affect the final image size. The overall space complexity is O(N^2), where N is the size of the QR code matrix, as it needs to store the entire matrix in memory before generating the image.

Overall, the script efficiently generates a QR code and saves it as an image with minimal resource usage.
