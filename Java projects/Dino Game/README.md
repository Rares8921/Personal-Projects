## What It Does

A faithful recreation of the iconic Chrome offline dinosaur game, built entirely in JavaFX. The classic endless runner that everyone plays when the internet dies.

**Gameplay Features:**
- **Endless Running** - Infinite side-scrolling desert landscape
- **Jump Mechanic** - Press spacebar to jump over obstacles
- **Obstacle Variety** - Cacti of different heights (1-cactus, 3-cacti, 4-cacti)
- **Score Tracking** - Points increase over time, displays current score
- **High Score** - Persistent high score saved between sessions
- **Increasing Difficulty** - Obstacles spawn faster and move quicker as score increases
- **Sound Effects:**
  - Jump sound (when dinosaur jumps)
  - Score milestone sound (every 100 points)
  - Death sound (collision with obstacle)
- **Game Over Screen** - Shows final score with replay button

**Visual Features:**
- Animated dinosaur sprite (running animation)
- Parallax cloud movement
- Scrolling ground tiles
- Day/night mode visuals
- Game-over screen with replay button

**Controls:**
- **Spacebar** - Jump
- **P** - Pause/Resume
- **R** - Restart after game over
- **Esc** - Close game

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** JavaFX 11 + FXML + CSS  
**Graphics:** JavaFX ImageView + Animation API  
**Backend:** Java 11 + Timeline-based game loop  
**Audio:** JavaFX Media (WAV files)  
**Build:** Maven/Gradle compatible  
**Pattern:** MVC with game state management

### Architecture

Game loop architecture with collision detection:

```
Main.java (Application)
      ↓
sample.fxml + Controller.java
      ↓
Game Loop (Timeline, 60 FPS)
      ↓
Game Entities:
  ├── Dino.java (Player character)
  ├── Enemy.java (Cacti obstacles)
  ├── Floor.java (Ground tiles)
  └── Cloud.java (Background clouds)
      ↓
Collision Detection (Bounds intersection)
      ↓
Game State:
  ├── Running (active gameplay)
  ├── Paused (frozen state)
  └── Game Over (death screen)
      ↓
Sound.java (Audio playback)
```

**Key Implementation Details:**
- **Timeline Animation:** JavaFX Timeline running at ~60 FPS for smooth gameplay
- **Collision Detection:** Bounding box intersection between Dino and Enemy objects
- **Sprite Animation:** KeyFrame-based sprite cycling for dino running frames
- **Procedural Generation:** Enemies spawn at random intervals with increasing frequency
- **State Persistence:** High score saved to AppData folder (`dinogamefile.dat`)
- **Difficulty Scaling:** Enemy speed increases by 5% every 100 points

**Physics:**
- Gravity simulation for jump arc (parabolic motion)
- Ground collision detection keeps dino grounded
- Jump velocity: Initial upward force + gravity pull

## Getting Started

**Requirements:**
- Java 11+ with JavaFX
- Maven (optional)

**Build & Run:**

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "d:\Personal-Projects\Java projects\Dino Game"

# Run with JavaFX
java --module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk/lib \
     --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.media \
     sample.Main
```

**Or run from IDE:**
1. Open project in IntelliJ IDEA
2. Configure JavaFX SDK
3. Run `Main.java`

**How to Play:**
1. Launch game
2. Press **Start** button
3. Press **Spacebar** to jump over cacti
4. Avoid hitting obstacles
5. Survive as long as possible
6. Beat your high score!

**Tips:**
- Different cacti require different jump timing
- Score increases every ~130ms (about 10 points per second initially)
- Speed increases make later stages harder
- Sound cues help with timing

## What's Next

Future enhancements to expand the game:

- **Mobile Controls** - Touch/click to jump (for mobile deployment)
- **Duck Mechanic** - Down arrow to duck under flying pterodactyls
- **Power-Ups** - Shields, slow-motion, or score multipliers
- **Level System** - Progress through themed stages (desert, mountains, night)
- **Leaderboard** - Online high score tracking with player names
- **Achievements** - Unlock badges for milestones (100 pts, 1000 pts, etc.)
- **Skins** - Unlock different dinosaur skins and obstacle themes
- **Multiplayer** - Race against friends in real-time
- **Procedural Music** - Dynamic soundtrack that evolves with difficulty
- **Particle Effects** - Dust clouds, cactus debris on collision
