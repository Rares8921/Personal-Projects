## What It Does

A complete chess implementation with both player-vs-player and player-vs-AI modes. Every rule is properly implemented, from basic moves to special actions like castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.

**Core Features:**
- **2-Player Mode** - Play against a friend on the same computer
- **AI Opponent** - Challenge a minimax-based chess engine
- **Full Rule Implementation** - All standard chess rules enforced
- **Move Validation** - Only legal moves allowed
- **Check Detection** - Automatic check/checkmate recognition
- **Special Moves** - Castling (king-side/queen-side), en passant, pawn promotion
- **Piece Highlighting** - Visual indicators for legal moves when piece is selected
- **Move History** - Track all moves with algebraic notation
- **Game State Tracking** - Undo/redo, save/load game positions

**Chess Rules Implemented:**
- Basic piece movement (pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, king)
- Capture mechanics
- Check, checkmate, and stalemate detection
- Castling (only when neither king nor rook has moved, path is clear, king not in check)
- En passant (pawn capture)
- Pawn promotion (auto-promote to queen or choose piece)
- Fifty-move rule
- Threefold repetition rule
- Insufficient material draw detection

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** JavaFX 11 + Custom Board Rendering  
**Backend:** Java 11 + Object-Oriented Chess Logic  
**AI Engine:** Minimax Algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning  
**Build:** Maven with modular Java (module-info)  
**Architecture:** Layered domain model with separation of concerns

### Architecture

Clean domain-driven design with validation and evaluation layers:

```
JavaFX UI (Board Rendering)
      ↓
Game Controller
      ↓
Game.java (Game State Management)
      ↓
Board.java (8x8 Grid)
      ↓
Field.java (Individual Square)
      ↓
Piece (Abstract) → King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight, Pawn
      ↓
Move.java (Move Object)
      ↓
MoveValidator (Legal Move Checking)
      ↓
GameEvaluator (Check/Checkmate/Stalemate/Draw)
```

**AI Implementation:**
- **Minimax Algorithm:** Recursive game tree search with configurable depth
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning:** Optimization to skip irrelevant branches
- **Position Evaluation:** Scoring based on material, position, king safety
- **Move Ordering:** Queen captures first for better pruning efficiency

**Key Classes:**
- **Game.java:** Central game loop, move execution, state management
- **Board.java:** 8x8 field array, piece positioning
- **Piece Hierarchy:** Abstract `Piece` class with concrete implementations
- **MoveValidator:** Static validation methods (legal move checking, path obstruction, king safety)
- **GameEvaluator:** Check detection, checkmate, stalemate, draw conditions
- **FENBuilder:** Export game state to FEN notation

## Getting Started

**Requirements:**
- Java 11+ with JavaFX
- Maven (optional)

**Build & Run:**

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "d:\Personal-Projects\Java projects\Chess"

# Run with JavaFX modules
java --module-path /path/to/javafx-sdk/lib \
     --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml \
     -m sample/sample.application.Main
```

**Or run from IDE (IntelliJ IDEA recommended):**
1. Open project as Maven/Gradle project
2. Configure JavaFX SDK in project settings
3. Run `Main.java`

**How to Play:**
1. Launch application
2. Choose mode: **2 Players** or **vs AI**
3. Click piece to select (legal moves highlight)
4. Click destination square to move
5. Game enforces all rules automatically
6. Checkmate/stalemate detected automatically
