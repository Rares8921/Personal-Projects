# Java Password Generator

## Code Summary

This Java program is a desktop application designed to generate strong passwords through a graphical user interface (GUI). It leverages the Swing framework for the UI components and includes custom elements to enhance the user experience. The application is styled with a dark theme and provides options for selecting different types of characters (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols) and password length.

## Program Description and Usage

### Main Components

1. **Main Class (`Main`)**:
   - The primary class that extends `JFrame` to create the main application window.
   - Uses `FlowLayout` for arranging components and sets a consistent dark background color for the entire interface.
   - Customizes various UI elements like buttons, radio buttons, and tooltips to maintain a cohesive look and feel.

2. **Password Length Selector**:
   - A `JSlider` component allows the user to select the desired password length, ranging from 8 to 32 characters. The selected length is displayed dynamically.

3. **Character Type Selection**:
   - Custom `MyRadioButton` components enable users to choose the types of characters to include in the password (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).

4. **Generate Button**:
   - A custom `MyButton` labeled "Generate" that initiates the password generation process based on user selections. It features custom hover and pressed states for better user interaction.

5. **Password Display**:
   - A `JTextArea` is used to show the generated password. It includes a tooltip feature to copy the password to the clipboard when focus is lost.

### Custom Components

- **MyButton**:
  - A subclass of `JButton` with overridden paint methods to provide custom background colors on hover and press.

- **CustomJToolTip**:
  - A custom tooltip with dark background and white text, matching the application's theme.

- **MyRadioButton**:
  - A custom radio button class that modifies the default content area and border painting to fit the dark theme.

## Method of Generating the Password

The password generation process involves the following steps:

1. **Character Pool Creation**: Based on user selections, a pool of characters is created. The pool can include:
   - Lowercase letters (`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz`)
   - Uppercase letters (`ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`)
   - Numbers (`1234567890`)
   - Symbols (`!@#$%^&*()_][{}`)

2. **Random Selection**: A password of the specified length is generated by randomly selecting characters from the pool. The selection is done using `Math.random()` to ensure randomness.

3. **Display and Clipboard Copy**: The generated password is displayed in a `JTextArea`. Additionally, it can be copied to the clipboard when focus is lost from the text area.

## Time and Space Complexity Analysis

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: Setting up the UI components and applying styles is constant time, O(1).
- **Password Generation**: The time complexity depends on the length of the password (`n`) and the number of characters available (`m`):
  - Creating the character pool takes O(m).
  - Generating the password involves `n` selections, each taking O(1). Therefore, the total time complexity is O(m + n).

### Space Complexity

- **Memory Usage**: The space complexity is determined by the storage of the character pool and the generated password:
  - Character pool: O(m) space.
  - Generated password: O(n) space.
  - Additional UI components and state variables contribute to a constant space overhead.

Overall, the space complexity is O(m + n).
